    <h4>An undoubtedly nonsensical list of recipes - resembling each other only the fact that they are absolute must-have dishes, and some of my all-time favourites. Hopefully, their simplicity and deliciousness will help others shed the college cycle of "pasta with unseasoned tomato sauce" and "instant ramen".</h4>
