    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you've never had homemade pasta carbonara before, you're in for a real treat! Pasta carbonara typically features a creamy sauce that's made with pancetta, garlic, heavy cream, cheese and eggs. The egg-based sauce is cooked by combining it with the piping hot spaghetti pasta and a little of the cooking water.</p>

    <p>For this easy carbonara recipe, I used bacon instead of pancetta since it's generally easier to find. But otherwise this is a pretty authentic carbonara recipe!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8-10 slices bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>8 and 1/2 cups water, divided</li>
        <li>1 lb spaghetti or linguine</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups finely grated parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tsp each salt and pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley , for garnish</li>
    </ul>
 
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add bacon and 1/2 cup of the water to a large non-stick skillet and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Allow to simmer until water evaporates about 6 - 7 minutes, then reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook until bacon is brown and crisp, about 6-8 minutes longer.</li>
        <li>Place a fine mesh strainer over a bowl then pour bacon into strainer while reserving about 1 tsp of the rendered fat in pan. Return pan to heat and saute garlic about 30 seconds, until fragrant and lightly golden.</li>
        <li>Pour into a medium mixing bowl then add 1 Tbsp rendered bacon fat (drippings in bowl set under strainer) to mixing bowl with garlic. Add eggs, egg yolk, parmesan and pepper to garlic mixture and whisk until well combined.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring 8 cups of water to a boil in a large dutch oven (no more than 8 cups because you want a very starchy water for the sauce). Add spaghetti and salt to boiling water and cook until al dente. While pasta is boiling, set a colander in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Carefully drain al dente pasta into colander in bowl, while reserving pasta water in bowl. Measure out 1 cup hot pasta water and discard remaining water. Immediately place pasta in now empty large bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour and whisk 1/2 cup pasta water into egg mixture, then slowly pour mixture over pasta while tossing to coat. Add bacon and toss to combine. Season with salt if desired.</li>
        <li>Let pasta rest, tossing frequently, 2 - 4 minutes until sauce has thickened slightly and coats pasta. Thin with remaining 1/2 cup hot pasta water as needed. Serve immediately topped with additional parmesan and parsley.</li>
    </ol>
