    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter chicken is a modern Indian dish, originating—according to Madhur Jaffrey (and we always defer to her!)—at the Moti Mahal restaurant in Delhi in the 1950s. But in just a few decades, it has fast become a globally beloved dish. After one bite of the generously spiced, savory tomato-cream sauce and the tender chicken that's cooked in it, it's not hard to understand why butter chicken has had such a stratospheric rise from kitchen experiment to absolute staple. We're crazy for this dish. We've even adapted the recipe to be made in a slow-cooker. But today, we're focused on an equally simple way of making this dish—say hello to your beloved butter chicken, cooked quickly and easily in a skillet on the stovetop! The whole thing takes under 30 minutes to make, and (of course) only requires you to dirty one pan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated yellow onion</li>
        <li>2 tbsp grated ginger</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter</li>
        <li>3/4 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>8 oz tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>2.5 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast cut into 2" cubes</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet with a tight fitting lid, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in onions, garlic and ginger. Cook, stirring often, until onions are soft and garlic and ginger are fragrant, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add in butter, chicken stock, tomato paste, cinnamon, salt, cumin, garam masala and turmeric. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Stir in chicken and stir until coated. Cover and cook for 15 minutes, until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Stir in lemon juice and heavy cream. Return to a simmer and cook until heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve butter chicken over basmati rice topped with fresh cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
