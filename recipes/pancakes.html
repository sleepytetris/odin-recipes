    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn't love a good pancake? Or two... or a plateful. Tried, tested and wonderfully old-fashioned, this simple recipe will soon become a family favourite.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 and 1/4 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
